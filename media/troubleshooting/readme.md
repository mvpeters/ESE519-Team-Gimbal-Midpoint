Current problems with the python code include the code timing out when the angle reading moves below 0 degrees or past 180 degrees. The servos can only move 180 degrees so going past that causes an error. I didn't look into fixing it with the python code since that was just used to test the components working together but in the C code we will probably just add an if statement that going past those thresholds sets it to the minimum or maximum angle. Realisticly the angles being used when the rocket launches will never be close to 0 or 180 degrees because that means the rocket would be launching horizontally.
