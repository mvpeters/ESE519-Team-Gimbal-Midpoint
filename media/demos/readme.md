Attached are a few gifs of our midpoint design

The first is a video of the demo we showed on friday, the three servos turn based on the angle that the MPU sensor turns at. It works for X, Y, Z directions.

The second is the sensor values reading from the C code. The next step is to use these to do the PWM for the servos in C.
